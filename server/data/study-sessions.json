It involves algorithms that can identify patterns and make predictions based on input data. Common types include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Neural networks are a popular approach inspired by the human brain's structure and function. Deep learning uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input.",
